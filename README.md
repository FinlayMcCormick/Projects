# Projects
My name is Finlay McCormick and I am currently an undergraduate student studying at Aberystwyth University. This repository contains some of the projects I have done.

The Pathfinding Project Code zip contains 3 python files, 5 text documents, an image and a pychache folder. The Pathfinding Project Documentation pdf covers my work on the project. Both of these are part of my A-level computer science assignment where I made a pathfinding program to find efficient routes through my old school.

The C Project zip contains a zipped CLion project, 2 screencasts, a readme and a report pdf. This is from my 2nd year C & C++ assignment where I made a program to analyse GPS data in text documents. The program won't work because the GPS data and configuration documents aren't included, however it can be seen running in the screencasts.

The Finlay McCormick 2018 AI EPQ pdf is my EPQ discussing the potential benefits and dangers of artificial intelligence in the future.
