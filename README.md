# Projects
My name is Finlay McCormick and I am currently an undergraduate student studying at Aberystwyth University. This repository contains some of the projects I have done.

The pathfinding project code zip contains 3 python files, 5 text documents, an image and a pychache folder. The pathfinding project documentation is a pdf covering my work on the project. Both of these are part of my A-level computer science assignment where I had to make a pathfinding program to find efficient routes through my old school.
