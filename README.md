# Projects
My name is Finlay McCormick and I am currently an undergraduate student studying at Aberystwyth University. This repository contains some of the projects I have done.

The Pathfinding Project Code zip contains 3 python files, 5 text documents, an image and a pychache folder. The Pathfinding Project Documentation pdf covers my work on the project. Both of these are part of my A-level computer science assignment where I made a pathfinding program to find efficient routes through my old school.

The C Project zip contains a zipped CLion project, 2 screencasts, a readme and a report pdf. This is from my 2nd year C & C++ assignment where I made a program to analyse GPS data in text documents. The program won't work because the GPS data and configuration documents aren't included, however it can be seen running in the screencasts.

The Java Sudoku Solver Code zip contains an IntelliJ IDEA project, my code is found at programmingAssignment\src\uk\ac\aber\cs21120\solution. The Java Sudoku Solver Documentation pdf is a short summary of the project. Both of these are part of my 2nd year algorithms and data structures assignment where I made a program to solve provided sudoku puzzles using interfaces. The program needs the JUnit testing framework to run.

The Finlay McCormick 2018 AI EPQ pdf is my EPQ discussing the potential benefits and dangers of artificial intelligence in the future.

The Arduino C Game Project zip contains a report, a testing document and an INO file containing the code. This is from my 1st year introduction to programming module where I made a game using a custom Arduino shield and a library. The game has you dodge obstacles on a 10x10 LED screen which get faster as the game goes on or you are hit, until you lose.

The CodeweaversFinlayMcCormickSolution zip contains code for a programming task assigned by the company Codeweavers for my job application with them, it is in C# using the .NET framework. For this task I was given given a half completed program which I had to fix and add to so that it could pass 7 provided tests.
